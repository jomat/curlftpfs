CurlFtpFS
=========

CurlFtpFS is a filesystem for acessing ftp hosts based on FUSE and
libcurl. It automatically reconnects if the server times out. 

My motivation to start this project was to learn how to program using
Curl (http://curl.haxx.se) and Fuse (http://fuse.sourceforge.net). I
also wanted to maintain my website (http://www.golaberto.com.br) using
the tools that I was used to, like cd, mv, cp and vim.

As the FTP protocol is not very feature rich, this filesystem does not
fulfill every constraint of a real filesystem, but it should be usable
for simple tasks like copying and editing files.

Requirements
============

glib-2.0
libcurl >= 7.17.0


Compilation and Installation
============================

autoupdate
autoreconf --install --force --verbose "."
./configure
make
make install

Usage
=====

curlftpfs <ftpsite> <mountpoint>

ex.:
curlftpfs ftp://ftp.sunet.se/ sunet/


Debugging
=========

curlftpfs -f -v -o debug,ftpfs_debug=3 <ftpsite> <mountpoint> 

(runs the curlftpfs in foreground and shows libcurl verbose debug output)  


Known Problems
==============

1) Several GUI application (gedit, leafpad,...) use open(O_RDWR) + seek mode for saving files 
which cannot be supported by the FTP protocol. Therefore saving files might throw an error.
Hopefully future kernels will provide special errno's to make it easier to 
deal with less capable file-systems.

2) There seems to be a bug in libcurl 7.18 which sometimes causes problems reading files. 
Should be fixed in libcurl >= 7.18.2
